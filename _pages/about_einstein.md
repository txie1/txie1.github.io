I am a 4th-year `Applied Mathematics` undergraduate student at `UCLA`. 

My research interests are in `Explainable AI`, `Generative Models`, and `LLMs`. Currently, I am working on interpretation methods for deep learning models, seeking to shed light on the inner workings of these "black-box" models and making AI more transparent. I am grateful to be advised by [Prof. Cho-Jui Hsieh](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/) at the [UCLA Computational Machine Learning Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/chohsieh-research/home) as an undergrad researcher.

Feel free to connect with me and explore new opportunities, collaborations, and exciting ventures together!
